STRING ## Overview
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING This document defines the **classification system for prototypes** within aarg. Prototypes are early-stage experimental inventions that have not yet graduated to full versioned inventions. Instead of version numbers, prototypes are categorized using a **quality enum system** to define their expected level of refinement.

STRING ## Prototype Classification System (Quality Enums)
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING Each prototype is tagged in its filename with an enum that describes its intended **quality level**:
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING  _ 
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING ### **Quality Levels**
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **`-WC`** (World Class) → Designed to impress the smartest minds on Earth. Requires exceptional polish, performance, and documentation.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **`-CC`** (Corporate Class) → Ready for enterprise-level deployment, scalable and well-structured.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **`-MC`** (Medium Class) → Functional for mid-sized operations, reliable but not cutting-edge.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **`-SC`** (Small Class) → Works well for small teams or startups, practical but with some rough edges.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **`-GC`** (Garage Class) → A rough proof-of-concept, meant for internal experimentation only.

STRING ## File Naming Convention
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING Each prototype must use the following format:
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING ```
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING [invention_name]-[quality_enum].boox
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING ```

STRING ## Transitioning from Prototype to Invention
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING Once a prototype is **refined enough for structured development**, it **graduates** to a full invention. At this stage:
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING  _ 
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING 1. The prototype **loses its quality enum**.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING 2. It moves into a **versioned URI-based structure**, maintaining a consistent naming convention.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING 3. A structured specification (`meta.md`) is created to define its development path.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING  _ 
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING **Example transition:**
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING ```
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING Before: AIChatbot-GC.boox (Garage Class Prototype)
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING After: aarg.inventions.v1,0,0.AIChatbot.v1,0,0.meta.md

STRING ## Versioning System for Inventions
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Versioning follows a strict format**: `v<major>,<minor>,<patch>`.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **All inventions must have three version digits** (e.g., `v1,0,0`).
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **There is no distinction between folders and domains**; all objects follow the exact URI format.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Each versioned object must include a `meta.md`** file that describes its structure and purpose.
ENTER

STRING ## Purpose of This System
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Maintains flexibility in the prototype phase** without rigid versioning.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Clearly defines expected quality levels** so effort matches the intended audience.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Provides an easy way to filter and sort prototypes** based on their level of refinement.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Ensures a structured graduation process** when an idea is ready for full development.
ENTER
DELAY 500
STRING - **Creates a uniform, predictable versioning structure** across all aarg components.
